- 👋 Hi, my name is Davinder Lally or @ogchem!
- 👀 I’m interested in Solana and Python at the moment. I want to become a developer in the future and help develop future projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and how to code. My goal is to learn how to be an expert on 721 contracts either EVM related or on Solana. I believe that Solana and other chains will start to take some market share from ETH. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner level projects so I can get more experience in coding, Solana, and more. 
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub or my email, greenguysmoney@gmail.com


I will be continously updating this file below on my developments!
